# AMAU-Net / F3 Netherlands Benchmark — SPLIT CONFIG (precomputed splits)
#
# This file does NOT regenerate the spatial split from the full 3D volume.
# It only documents and points to the already-saved split files used in
# our experiments:
#   - train/train_seismic.npy  + train/train_labels.npy
#   - validation/test2_seismic.npy + validation/test2_labels.npy
#   - test/test1_seismic.npy   + test/test1_labels.npy  (Benchmark Test set #1)
#
# Important:
# - The F3 dataset is NOT redistributed in this repository.
# - Users must set `base_dir` to their local/Drive path where these .npy
#   files are stored.
