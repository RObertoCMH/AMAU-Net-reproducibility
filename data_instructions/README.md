# Data instructions (F3 Netherlands facies benchmark)

This repository does **not** redistribute the F3 dataset nor any derived large arrays.

To reproduce the experiments, you must download the **Facies Classification Benchmark (Netherlands F3)** from the original authors and place it locally following the expected layout.

- See: `GET_F3.md` for download and setup steps.
- See: `GET_F3.md#expected-local-layout` for the exact `.npy` paths used by the scripts/configs.
