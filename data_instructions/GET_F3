# Getting the F3 Netherlands facies benchmark (Alaudah et al.)

## Why this folder exists
This repository follows a benchmark split on the Netherlands F3 block and reports results under a fixed spatial protocol.
Because the dataset is large, we do **not** redistribute it here. You must download it from the original authors.

## Official source (recommended)
The benchmark dataset is provided by the authors of:
“A Machine Learning Benchmark for Facies Classification” (Alaudah et al., 2019).

**Zenodo record (dataset DOI):** 10.5281/zenodo.3755060  
The record provides (at least) `data.zip` and `raw.zip`.

> Tip: Start with `data.zip` (it typically includes the benchmark-ready split and files needed for training/testing).

## Alternative source (same authors)
The authors also host code + references to the dataset on GitHub:
- https://github.com/yalaudah/facies_classification_benchmark
(or the OLIVES mirror / fork)

If you use the GitHub route, prefer the Zenodo data for stable versioning and DOI citation.

## Benchmark split (paper protocol)
Inline 300 and crossline 1000 divide the survey into four regions.

The benchmark defines (ranges inclusive):
- **Training set (NW block):** inlines [300, 700], crosslines [300, 1000]
- **Test set #1 (SW block):** inlines [100, 299], crosslines [300, 1000]
- **Test set #2 (E block):** inlines [100, 700], crosslines [1001, 1200]

This repository uses:
- **Validation = Test set #2**
- **Test = Test set #1** (held-out benchmark “Test set #1”)

## Expected local layout
The scripts/configs in this repo expect **NumPy arrays** stored under a user-defined base directory (not committed to git).

Set your base directory in `configs/split.yaml`, e.g.
`data.base_dir: "/absolute/path/to/your/data"`

Then the following files are expected:

- `train/train_seismic.npy`
- `train/train_labels.npy`

- `validation/test2_seismic.npy`
- `validation/test2_labels.npy`

- `test/test1_seismic.npy`
- `test/test1_labels.npy`

Notes:
- `*_seismic.npy` should be float arrays.
- `*_labels.npy` should be integer arrays with class IDs matching the manuscript (6 facies).

## How to place the files after download
After downloading and unzipping the benchmark from Zenodo, inspect its folder structure.

You may need to do one of the following:
1) **Rename** the provided split folders to match `train/`, `validation/`, `test/`, or
2) **Copy** the corresponding `.npy` arrays into the expected paths above, or
3) **Symlink** from your local dataset folder into the expected structure.

This repo intentionally keeps the file naming explicit so the split is unambiguous.

## Sanity checks (recommended)
Before training, verify:
- arrays load correctly
- seismic/labels shapes match
- labels are in the expected class range

Example (run locally):

```python
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

base = Path("/absolute/path/to/your/data")  # must match configs/split.yaml

paths = [
    base/"train/train_seismic.npy",
    base/"train/train_labels.npy",
    base/"validation/test2_seismic.npy",
    base/"validation/test2_labels.npy",
    base/"test/test1_seismic.npy",
    base/"test/test1_labels.npy",
]

for p in paths:
    arr = np.load(p)
    print(p.name, arr.shape, arr.dtype)

y = np.load(base/"train/train_labels.npy")
print("train labels:", y.min(), y.max(), "unique:", len(np.unique(y)))
